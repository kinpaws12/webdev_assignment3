## events and role workflow
User, Organizer, and Admin

1. An Event starts in status of 'Pending' when it is created by Organizer.

2. Admin will audit all created events to decide either 'Approve' or 'Reject':

PENDING  →  APPROVED  (or)  REJECTED
               │
               ▼
           CANCELLED   (if organiser calls it off later)

3. Only events in 'Approved' can be returned back to public Api.
